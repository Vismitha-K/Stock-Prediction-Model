# üìä Hybrid LSTM + Linear Regression Stock Price Prediction

A machine learning project that forecasts future stock prices using a **hybrid model combining LSTM and Linear Regression**.  
The model learns both **sequential trends** (via LSTM) and **linear relationships** (via Linear Regression) from historical stock data and technical indicators like **SMA, EMA, and RSI**.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project aims to predict the **next 7 days of stock prices** based on past historical data.  
It uses a **hybrid deep learning and statistical approach**, combining the **pattern-recognition capability of LSTM** with the **trend-fitting ability of Linear Regression**.

The system automatically:
- Takes a **stock ticker symbol** (e.g., `AAPL`, `TSLA`, `RELIANCE.NS`)
- Fetches historical data using **Yahoo Finance API (`yfinance`)**
- Computes technical indicators (**SMA, EMA, RSI**)
- Trains a **hybrid forecasting model**
- Displays both **predicted and actual trends** via interactive visualization

---

## üéØ Objectives

- Build a predictive model for short-term stock price forecasting  
- Use **SMA**, **EMA**, and **RSI** indicators for feature enhancement  
- Combine deep learning (LSTM) and statistical regression (Linear Regression)  
- Ensure the system dynamically adapts to **any stock ticker**  
- Visualize trends and future predictions interactively

## üß† Motivation / Inspiration

Stock markets are highly dynamic and influenced by complex patterns.  
This project was inspired by the idea of combining **statistical learning** and **deep learning** to capture both **short-term volatility** and **long-term trends**.

> ‚ÄúI wanted to understand how preprocessing and feature engineering can significantly influence model accuracy and interpretability ‚Äî especially in real-world financial data.‚Äù

## üìà Feature Engineering Details

| Feature | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **SMA (Simple Moving Average)** | Shows average trend over a defined period; used to identify price direction |
| **EMA (Exponential Moving Average)** | Gives more weight to recent prices for responsiveness |
| **RSI (Relative Strength Index)** | Measures price momentum ‚Äî helps detect overbought or oversold conditions |

Additional preprocessing steps:
- Handled missing data using forward-fill
- Scaled all features to 0‚Äì1 range using **MinMaxScaler**
- Aligned feature data with correct prediction targets
- Used rolling 60-day sequences to avoid time leakage
